Repository of useful scripts.

## `black_selection.sh`

Followed the blog post [Partial Python code formatting with Black & PyCharm][1]
and made some improvementss.  The main improvement was a workaround for 
[`sed` failing on empty files][2].

## `flush_dns_cache.sh`

Converted the commands listed in the articles 
[MacPaw How to Flush DNS cache on Mac][3] and 
[DreamHost Flushing your DNS cache in Mac OS X and Linux][4] to a shell script.
